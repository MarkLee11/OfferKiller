Combined Usage Recommendation (0 → 1 Project Workflow)

1. Kick-off: Use GPT-5 for requirements and ideation → generate user stories and an MVP feature list

2. Design Phase: Hand it over to Claude Opus 4.1 → produce the tech stack, system architecture diagrams, and phased development plan

3. Core Implementation: Let Claude handle the main business modules, while Gemini 2.5 Pro supplements with key algorithms & cross-modal details

4. Final Touches: Use GPT-5 to craft polished documentation, and Gemini to generate/execute test cases → delivering a pre-launch polish
