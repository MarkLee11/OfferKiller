Please create a new file in prompt/step 6.md that fully expands step 6 from outline.md.

Continue the same style and structure as in previous step markdown files.

Include every detail I need to know, assuming I have zero prior knowledge.

Whenever I need to prepare, install, or configure something, make the location and instructions very explicit.

If the step requires Linux commands or configuration in another app/tool, tell me immediately so I can run them and return the results.

If it requires Windows actions , you can do them all by yourself.

Treat this like a workflow collaboration:

You write the explanations, configs, and automation code that you can write.

When manual execution is needed, you stop and let me perform it.

After I give feedback, you continue.

At the end of each step, clearly define how we can verify success (tests, checks, or expected output).
